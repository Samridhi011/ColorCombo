# Color Combination Advisor for Clothing Selection
## Abstract
Choosing the right color combination for clothing can greatly impact one's appearance and confidence in various settings. This project aims to develop a machine learning model that helps users select the optimal color combinations for different occasions such as meetings, casual outings, or formal events. By analyzing color psychology and fashion trends, the model suggests the most suitable color combinations based on the user's preferences and the context of the event. The project utilizes machine learning algorithms and other technologies to provide personalized recommendations, enhancing users' fashion choices and confidence.
